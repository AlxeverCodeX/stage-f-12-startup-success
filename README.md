# Startup Investments #
*Venture deals, organizations, people and exits*

**Content**

This diverse dataset contains information about the startup ecosystem: organizations, individuals, company news, funding rounds, acquisitions, and IPOs.

There are 11 tables that can be joined using unique IDs (schema to follow). More information about the individual data variables can be found on the Crunchabse Data website (under the API Entities Types section).

No extensive data quality check have been performed yet. The information is available up to December 2013.

While Kaggle contains other datasets focused on startup investments, to the best of my knowledge, this dataset has not yet been published on the platform and is unique.
